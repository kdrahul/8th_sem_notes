# Convergence of IT and IoT

- IT:
> **IT** supports connections to the Internet along with the related data and technology systems and is focused on the secure flow of data across an organization

- OT:
> **OT** monitors and controls devices and processes on physical operational systems. These systems include assembly lines, utility distribution networks, production facilities and many more.

- Difference between IT and OT

| Criterion | Industrial OT Network | Enterprise IT Network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operational Focus | Keep the business operational 24x7 | Manage the computers, data, and employee communication system in a secure way |
| Priorities | 1. Availability 2. Integrity 3. Security | 1. Security 2. Integrity 3. Availability |
| Types of Data | Monitoring, control and supervisory data | Voice, video, transactional and bulk data |
| Security | Controlled physical access to devices | Devices and users authenticated to the network |
| Implication of failure | OT network disruption directly impacts business | Can be business impacting, depending on industry, but workarounds may be mitigated |
| Upgrades | Only during operational maintenance windows | Often requries an outage window when workers are not onsite; impact can be mitigated |
