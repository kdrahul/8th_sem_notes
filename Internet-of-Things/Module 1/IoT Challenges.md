# IoT Challenges

- **Scale**:
	- While the scale of IT networks can be large, the scale of OT can be several orders of magnitude.
		Example: One large electrical utility in Asia recently began deploying IPv6-based smart meters on its electrical grid.
	- While this utility company has tens of thousands of employees, the number of meters in the service area is tens of millions.
	- This means the scale of the network the utility is managing has increased by more than 1000 fold

- **Security**:
	- With more "things" becoming connected with other "things" and people, security is an increasingly complex issue for IoT. Your threat surface is now greatly expanded, and if a device gets hacked, its connectivity is a major concern.
	- A compromised device can serve as a launching point to attack other devices and systems.
	- IoT security is also pervasive across just about every facet of ioT.

- **Privacy**:
	- As sensors become more prolific in our everyday lives, much of the data they gather will be specific to individuals and their activities.
	- This data can range from health information to shopping patterns and transactions at a retail establishment.
	- For business, this is monetary value.
	- Organizations are nwo discussing who ows the data nd how individuals can control whether it is shared and with whom.

- **Big data and Data analytics**:
	- IoT and its large number of sensors is going to triggera deluge of data that must be handled.
	- This data will provide critical information and insights if it can be processed in an efficient manner.
	- The challenge is evaluating massive amounts of data arriving from different sources in various forms and doing so in a timely manner.

- **Interoperability**:
	- As with any other nascent technology, various protocols and architectures are jockeying for market share and standardization within IoT.
	- Some of these protocols and architectures are based on proprietary elements, and others are open.
	- Recent IoT standards are helping minimize this problem, but these are often various protocols and implementations available for IoT networks.
