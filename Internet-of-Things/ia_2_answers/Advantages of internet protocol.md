# Advantages of Internet Protocol

Advantages of IP suite for the Internet of Things are:

1. Open and standards-based
	- The IoT creates a new paradigm in which devices, applications, and users can leverage a large set of devices and functionalities while guaranteeing interchangeability and interoperability, security and management. This calls for implementation, validation and deployment of open, standard-based soluitons.
	- **IETF** is an open standard body that focuses on the development of the Internet Protocol suite and related Internet technologies and protocols
2. Versatile
	- Layered IP architecture is well equipped to cope with any type of physical and data link layers.
	- This makes IP ideal as a long-term investment because various protocols at these layers can be used in a deployment now and over time, without requiring changes to the whole solution architecture and data flow
3. Ubiquitous
	- All recent operating systems have dual IP stack which gets enhanced over time
	- IoT application protocols have been recently updated in many industrial OT solutions to run over IP.
	- Recent standardization efforts are adding IPv6 in several areas
	- IP is the most pervasive protocol when you look at what is supported across the various OiT solutions and industry verticals.
4. Scalable
	- IP has been massively deployed and tested for robust scalability.
	- IP has proven to be highly scalable, it's one of IP's strengths.
5. Manageable and highly secure
6. Stable and resilient
7. Comsumers' market adoption
8. Innovation factor
