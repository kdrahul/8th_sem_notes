# IoT and Digitization

_IoT_ and _digitization_ are terms that are often used interchangeably. In most contexts, this duality is fine, but there are key differences to be aware of.

- At a high level, IoT focuses on connecting "things", such as objects and machines, to a computer network, such as the Internet.
- IoT is a well understood term used across the industry as a whole.
- On the other hand, digitization can mean different things to different people but generally encompasses the connection of "things" with the data they generate and the business insights that result.

- Digitization, as defined in its simplest form, is the conversion of information into a digital form.
- Digitization has been happening in one form or another for several decades.

For example, the whole photography industry has been digitized. Pretty much everyone has  digital cameras these days, either standalone devices or built into their mobile phones. Almost no one buys film and takes it to a retailer to get it developed. The digitization of photography has completely changed our experience when it comes to capturing images.
