# Types of Sensors

| Sensor Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Position | Measures the position of the object. Measurement can be absolute or relative. | Proximity Sensor, Potentiometer, inclinometer |
| Occupancy and Motion | **Occupancy**: Detect the presense of people and animals in a surveillance area. **Motion**: Detects movement of people and objects. Difference is, **Occupancy** detects person when they are not in moving, while **Motion** doesn't. | Radar, Electric Eye |
| Velocity and Acceleration | **Velocity**: Indicates how fast an object is moving. **Acceleration**: measures change in velocity. | Accelerometer, Gyroscope |
| Force | Detects whether a physical force is applied and whether the magnitude of force beyond a threshold | Force Gauge, Viscometer, Tactile sensors |
| Pressure | Measures force in terms of force per unit area | Barometer, Bourdon gauge, Piezometer |
| Flow | Detects the rate of fluid flow | Water meter |
