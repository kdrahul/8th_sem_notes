# What is IoT
> A world where everything is online and communicating to other things and people to enhance people's lives like self-driving drones and sensors for monitoring your health, is collectively known as the **Internet-of-Things**(IoT).

### Basic goals of IoT

**"Connect the Unconnected"**

This means that objects not currently joined to the internet will be connected so that they can interact and communicate with other people and objects.

- IoT allows to sense and control the physical world by making objects smarter and connecting them through an intelligent network
- Integration between the physical world and computers allows for improvements in efficiency, accuracy, automation, and the enablement of advanced application.
