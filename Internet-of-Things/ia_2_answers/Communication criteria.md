## Range
Range is categorized into 3 ranges
1. Short range
2. Medium range
3. Long range

### Short range
The classical wired example is a serial cable. Wireless short-range technologies are often considered as an alternative to a serial cable, supporting tens of meters of maximum distance between two devices. Examples of short-range wireless technologies are IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.7 Visible Light Communications (VLC). These short-range communication methods are found in only a minority of IoT installations. In some cases, they are not mature enough for production deployment.

### Medium range
This range is the main category of IoT access technologies. In the range of tens to hundreds of meters, many specifications and implementations are available. The maximum distance is generally less than 1 mile between two devices, although RF technologies do not have real maximum distances defined, as long as the radio signal is transmitted and received in the scope of the applicable specification. Examples of medium-range wireless technologies include IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.15.4, and 802.15.4g WPAN. Wired technologies such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and IEEE 1901.2 Narrowband Power Line Communications (PLC) may also be classified as medium range, depending on

### Long range
Long range: Distances greater than 1 mile between two devices require long-range technologies. Wireless examples are cellular (2G, 3G, 4G) and some applications of outdoor IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) technologies. LPWA communications have the ability to communicate over a large area without consuming much power. These technologies are therefore ideal for battery-powered IoT sensors. Found mainly in industrial networks, IEEE 802.3 over optical fiber and IEEE 1901 Broadband Power Line Communications are classified as long range but are not really considered IoT access technologies.
